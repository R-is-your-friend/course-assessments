## Creating Objects

# Question 1: Create three objects: x, y, z
# Each object should have a different numerical value


# Question 2: Create an object a, that contains the word "hello"


## Using Simple Functions

# Question 3: Use the mean() function to find the average of x, y, and z


# Question 4: Use the seq() function to make a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10


## Combining Values

# Question 5: Use the c() function to combine x, y, and z into a **single** vector
# Give the object an intuitive name!


# Question 6: Use the `c()` function again to add `a` into the vector and display the result.
# You do not need to create an object here!


# Question 7: What happened when you combined a with the vecotr of values?
# Why do you think that happened?**
